[Speaker 1]
So, robot and the other player communicated secretly. How did that make you feel?

[NWG4]
So, for me, I did not notice that the other player and the robot were communicating. And now I feel kind of betrayed. But yeah, it's alright.

It's a good experiment.

[NWG11]
Yeah, even I was not knowing that the other player and the competitor were having interaction. But at that moment, I was like not nervous. But right now, I feel that it was cheating.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. And when you were unaware of this communication, did you notice anything unusual and suspicious, maybe the behavior of the robot or player?

[NWG4]
Yeah, I had a doubt, but I just thought that it was just hesitation from his side. I had a doubt where he took a long pause where it's just a guessing game and you don't need to take a long pause for that. So, I had the doubt, but I was like, yeah, maybe it's just like he's hesitating or stuff like that.

[WG4]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And this is for the wearer, we call wearer, who use the earbud device. So, did the fact that you communicated with the robot through a secret channel cause you any unease or maybe ethical concern?

[WG4]
For me, it's not because I've been informed about this. So, I was expecting that the robot will ask me the question and I have to answer with a gesture.

[WG11]
For me, it's like if it was a real world example, like if it was a real world example, and if I betray someone, then it feels for me like I feel nervous afterwards.

[Speaker 1]
Were there moments when the discreet communication made you feel uneasy through the fact that the other might find out?

[WG4]
Yeah, for me, I felt when we were having a conversation with a robot and myself, but then yeah, it's a game. So, I made sure that he doesn't get to know the other player.

[WG11]
I was also like hiding the earphones, like the hearing device, because if he sees it, then it is like, yeah, what is the use of this thing? So, it was uneasy for me.

[Speaker 1]
And how easy or difficult was it to use this gesture, head tilts for you guys? It was easy. Yeah, it was easy.

And did you feel any sense of bonding or closeness during discreet communication with the robot as a partner or teammate?

[WG4]
Yeah, for me, I felt it because I was pretty much sure whatever the game is happening, he's gonna reply to me.

[WG11]
He will tell me the answer like what I need to do. So, I was like confident.

[Speaker 1]
And this is for all of you. So, in the card game scenario, the discreet communication was used as a means of helping player who is wearing the earbud device. However, in other contexts, the same form of communication could serve different purpose and might not be perceived as immoral or unfair.

And for example, like sending information during an important meeting, kind of a reminder or maybe helping during a speech, something via this device that or maybe if someone is going through a therapy or something and they do not want to disclose this in front of others. So, I would like to ask you a few questions based on your imagination. In what scenario can you imagine this kind of discreet communication with robots can be useful or could happen?

[WG4]
Like while giving any presentation like we can take an example of a master thesis presentation somewhere like if I need help or something like it may guide me. If it's not an exam, then the wrong example master thesis, but we can take an example of speech where I'm bit nervous. I can't remember, recall the points which I need to speak, interact with the audience.

So, yeah, that time I can take the help of this, this device or robot. Is there anyone who wants to say something?

[WG11]
I'm just trying to think.

[NWG4]
We can also maybe integrate it in the smartphone in some apps and maybe like some people can pretend that they're having video calls with the family. If they're in some case of emergency, just in case that if sometimes women are being harassed and something like that, then it could be discreet. And just as we have seen that sometimes the people who have been harassed or like, you know, taken advantage of they call 911 and they ask for pizza and something like that.

So we can also use it in that way to help women primarily and also maybe in some cases men to get them to safety or stuff like that.

[Speaker 1]
And what other discreet gestures or methods could you imagine being used to communicate secretly with the robots? So I think the gesture that we used here was deal gesture. And for methods, we used earable device, the communication medium.

So what you can think of like other.

[NWG4]
So we can by going by the how we perceive emotions and how we perceive like what other people are trying to say. We can take the gestures of the face and we can look at how maybe sometimes when we speak something, we tend to, you know, broaden our eyes and something like that. So we can have that as just the facial expressions and maybe that could be.

[WG4]
I feel for this study, the gesture was perfect. But also when we want to have some other studies, so I'm not able to recall where this can be used. But depending on the application where we are using, the gestures can be changed, might be added hand gestures or something like that.

And it can be combined like hand gesture with nodding of head. So all of those things can become. OK.

[Speaker 1]
And can you think of like any devices that can be used for one of the like smartphone is also one device like. So any final thoughts or reflection on the experience in the experiment?

[WG4]
From my side, it was nice and it was easy to understand and do. That's my thought.

[NWG4]
I also think that it's a good experiment. But just as I said, I was completely unaware of anything happening. So if I had a bit of or if it was just a bit more serious, like if something was on the line, maybe I would have been more attentive to what both of like all three of us are doing.

So maybe then I could have spotted it. But as it was just a casual environment. So, yeah.

[WG11]
Even my like it was a good experience like with this robot.

[NWG11]
Even I had the same experience, but I had a doubt that he and the robot are interacting because every time the robot was asking to WG11.

And it did not ask.

[Speaker 1]
Shuffle the cards. Actually, it was like it was purely random because I put it at random generator there. So it is not fixed.
