[Speaker 1]
If you can like keep the phone in between somewhere like if you can put in this way. So, this is for the for you first of all. So, in the experiment we investigated the use of a secret or what we call discrete communication with a robot in the presence of others.

So, the other player had a secret interaction channels. So, the other player was having discrete interaction during the game via a earbud device which we use like this device and the robot was informing about its card to the player and the player was also informing about his card via head gestures. So, like doing like this.

So, they were exchanging the information about the card. So, this hidden interaction was not happening all the time, but only during one of the games that you played and the study was not intended to focus on cheating or any defeating the other players or deception, but rather on exploring that whether such hidden communication with a robot is feasible in a group setting. And you are selected as a non-user like not using the device.

So, you have no hidden communication with the robot and the other players was also not aware that you had something like a device. So, and you were like selected purely randomly as we decided whoever decides to enter in the lab when asked in the beginning if one of the user who has like whoever will use the system here will be selected for wearing the device. So, it was purely random.

So, if you have selected to sit here, then you will wear the device, it was like simple right. So, it was pure random and based on your overall experience in the game, I would like to ask you two questions. So, the robot and the player was communicated secretly, how did that make you feel?

[NWG7]
Like after playing the game, obviously, it will like feel like okay, I was not knowing about this thing. So, it will be kind of, but yeah that the first thing which will come in my mind.

[Speaker 1]
So, you feel like a betrayed or something like that. And so, when you were unaware of the secret communication, so did you notice anything unusual or suspicious about the behavior of the robot or player A, no, okay, yeah. So, I have now questions for you.

So, did that fact that you communicated with the robot through a secret channel caused you any unease or ethical concern?

[WG7]
No, not at all.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. And were there moments when the discrete communication made you feel uneasy through the fact that other might find out?

[WG7]
No.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. How easy or difficult was it to use this headgestures?

[WG7]
No, it was actually easy, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And do you feel any sense of like bonding or closeness with the discrete communication during the robot like having like a secret partner or friend who is helping you in the game?

[WG7]
Yes. It felt like that. Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Can you describe more like?

[WG7]
Yes. If I can communicate directly with the robot, I can make sure that there are more chances of me to win the game.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Now this is for both of you. Now in the card game scenario, this discrete communication was only used as a means of helping the player and not deceiving the other player.

However, in other contexts, the same form of communication could serve as different purpose, right? Might not be perceived as immoral or unfair to the others. Like for example, there is a secret communication between parents, they don't want the children to know about or something like in a meeting when the robot can send some important information to the user when others are also present, which could be advantageous to the person.

So these are some examples. Now I would like to ask you in what everyday scenario can you imagine some kind of discrete communication with robots if you can like maybe workplace, homes, healthcare or the example that I gave you?

[WG7]
In everyday life, I am not sure, but as you said, it can be used in a meeting if there are certain information which should be shared among a few employees and which are not should be shared with the client. And if there is a meeting going on between a client and a company or organization, then if there is an information which I need to share with only my employees and client should not be conflicted with the information, then we can use it.

[Speaker 1]
Can you think of a scenario like where the robot would be part of such kind of communication? It's fine if you don't like able to come up with something now, but what other discrete gesture or methods you could imagine being used? One example was head tilts like this, right?

So do you think that there are other gestures could be useful or can be used or can be implemented?

[WG7]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Or other methods like this is we use ear bud like this one method of communication, but of course, there are mobile application, notifications, variables, devices.

[WG7]
Gestures I think we can use it other than the head tilt. Maybe someone can use an eyebrow gesture like that. If I can raise my eyebrow, it will be more secretive than the other one because if I tilt it, maybe someone can notice if there are more people, more than two people, then someone can notice my head gesture.

But if I am just doing with the eyebrow, maybe someone cannot notice.

[NWG7]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And yeah, just a final question, any final thoughts or reflection you had for the experience you had with the experiment?

[WG7]
Yeah, it was the overall experience was really nice.

[Speaker 1]
Of course, it's nice for you because you had the device. For me, I didn't get any clue. But when you were guessing, so they both doesn't have a chance because you are guessing, it's pure your luck.

[NWG7]
Even I was feeling like how he is winning every time.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[NWG7]
Maybe luck or whatever he is guessing.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. Okay. Yeah.

So thank you for joining for this. I hope you enjoyed this game. Okay.
